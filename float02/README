see top level README for documentation and how to run this program

This is how you enable the floating point unit.  And some very
simple examples (in assembly).

read the float01 description, and come back

so not only does this line work right

    hexstring(ftoi(1234.0F/fdummy(1.20F)));

we can get the compiler to do the float to int conversion as well as
the division.

    hexstring(1234.0F/fdummy(1.20F));

420001f4:   eeb00a68    vmov.f32    s0, s17
420001f8:   ebffff93    bl  4200004c <fdummy>
420001fc:   ee880a00    vdiv.f32    s0, s16, s0
42000200:   eebc0ac0    vcvt.u32.f32    s0, s0
42000204:   ee100a10    vmov    r0, s0
42000208:   ebffffc9    bl  42000134 <hexstring>

I imagine there will be situations where you get gcclib function
calls and you just have to deal with that.
