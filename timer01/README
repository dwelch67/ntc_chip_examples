see top level README for documentation and how to run this program

Have not figured out how to get the sync timer going, but the async
is easy and is already running from uboot.  The top 4 bits change
every 11.25 seconds roughly so that is 2^28 / 11.25 which is around
24MHz.  The source is OSC24M so that is likely a 24MHz reference.

So roughly every 3 minutes the timer rolls over.
