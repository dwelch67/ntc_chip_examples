see top level README for documentation and how to run this program

Playing around.  At the moment we are in supervisor mode, both if launched
via spl or from uboot.  (The raspberry pi for example is now booting into
hypervisor mode before handing off to us.

Also did a quick memory check.  It appears we can write and read 0x0000
to 0xC000 which I assume is on chip SRAM.  Then dram is from 0x40000000
to 0x60000000 (512MB) in theory but that didnt work so I scaled it back
to test the first 256MB and that does work.  Very quick and dirty testing
thus far, little research, maybe the gpu uses this ram or something.

in fel mode use make run to load and run.  or in uboot loadx/y to 0x4000
then go 0x4000.
