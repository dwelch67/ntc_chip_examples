see top level README for documentation and how to run this program

So I did a blinker example after all, using the on board led.

Started with the i2c01 example.  Figured out the address for the APX209
was 0x34, and that with bit banging I didnt need much if any delay.

Register 0x93 controls GPIO2 which controls one of the leds (the other
may be hardwired to power, have to check).  The default setting is
0x07 for that register which is floating, so the circuit outside
can pull the led on.  If we write a 0 it pulls it low which turns off
the led.

This example will blink the led and write a character to the uart every
second.
