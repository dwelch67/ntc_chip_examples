see top level README for documentation and how to run this program

This is the first example, didnt init the uart because running from
the bootloader that already has the uart initialized, looks to be a
16550 (8250) clone so easy to setup anyway.  Dumping the registers
from uboot shows that the interrupts are not enabled so we dont have
to disable them or have to worry about uboot getting in our way.
