So I did a blinker example after all.

I have some of these with pins soldered on

any led will do, you probably want a resistor to be safe but I have been
known to just take good old fashioned leds

and shove them into pins.  you do take the risk of letting smoke out
the part.  and you have to get the orientation right for it to light
up (there are gnd and 3v3 pins to check with before going from gnd
to the I/O pin).

I guessed/assumed that the LCD pins were not being used.  All of port
D that they at least list PD2 to PD27 are LCD related which I am not
using right now, and despite the chip docs saying there are 8 gpios
that is likely when running linux, the A13 docs show zillions of gpios
7 ports worth.  So anyway picked LCD_D2 or PD2.  Configured it as a
simple output.  Used the timer from timer01, count to 24 million which
is one second, change the state of the output.  not using any of the
other Port D pins so I can just bang on the PD_OUT.  And the led
blinks.
